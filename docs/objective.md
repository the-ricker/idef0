# IDEF tool 

## Objective

I want to create a tool that allows me to create, edit and view IDEF0 diagrams in Cursor.

## Background on IDEF0

Documentation on IDEF0 can be found here:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDEF0
* https://syque.com/quality_tools/tools/Tools19.htm 
* https://www.lucidchart.com/blog/idef-diagrams
* https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-idef0-diagrams-ea7a9289-96e0-4df8-bb26-a62ea86417fc

I found two open source projects for IDEF0:

* https://github.com/jimmyjazz/IDEF0-SVG
* https://github.com/vorachet/FindFuncDSL


## Expectations

1. The tool runs as an extension in Cursor
1. The model is a YAML file
1. The file extension is .idef
1. I can text edit the model and view the diagram, much like markdown preview works in Cursor
